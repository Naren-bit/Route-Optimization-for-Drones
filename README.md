# Drone Route Optimization ðŸš€  
This project implements a real-time route optimization system for autonomous delivery drones, ensuring efficient navigation while considering multiple dynamic factors like weather, obstacles, and battery efficiency.  

## Features  
âœ… Multi-variable route optimization (weather, obstacles, regulations)  
âœ… A* pathfinding with obstacle avoidance  
âœ… QuadTree & Segment Tree for spatial data management  
âœ… Handles dynamic obstacles in real-time  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Route-Optimization-for-Drones.git
   cd Route-Optimization-for-Drones

2.Run the script:
    python main.py

3.Future Improvements
âœ… Real-time obstacle updates
âœ… Integration with real-world drone APIs
